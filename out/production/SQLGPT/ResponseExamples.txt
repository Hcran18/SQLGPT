SELECT DATEDIFF(return_date, checkout_date) AS checkout_duration
FROM CheckedOutBooks
WHERE book_id = (SELECT book_id FROM Book WHERE title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird');

Answer:
To determine the duration in days that To Kill a Mockingbird is checked out for, we need to examine the CheckedOutBooks table.
However, the data provided does not include the related checkout_date and return_date information for the specific book (To Kill a Mockingbird).
Therefore, we cannot accurately determine the length of time for which To Kill a Mockingbird is checked out.
